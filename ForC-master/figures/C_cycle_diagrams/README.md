## ForC C cycle diagrams

This folder will contain ensemble C cycle diagrams based on ForC data following the style of diagrams in Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2016 ([here](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/tree/master/figures/C_cycle_diagrams/archive)).

[This file](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/figures/C_cycle_diagrams/ForC_variables_mapping_for_C_cycle_diagrams.csv) maps variables onto C cycle diagram (*variable.diagram* field). It also records conversion factors by which measurement records should be multiplied to standardize units (*conversion.factor* field) and data filters that should be applied (*data.filter* field). The *variable.mapping.notes* field explains the logic behind the variable mapping.
