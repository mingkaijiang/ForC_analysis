## How to find original publications

1. **Indentify citation ID.** Citation ID's are given in MEASUREMENTS, SITES, METHODS, and ALLOMETRIES tables, as specified in the corresponding [metadata](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/tree/master/metadata). 

2. **Look up citation info in [ForC.citations.csv](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/data/ForC_citations.csv).** 

3. **Locate the publication.** In most cases, the CITATIONS table gives a DOI that can be used to easily locate the publication. When a DOI is not given (usually because one does not exist), reference can be looked up based on first author, publication year, and/or title. This process may be facilitated by the following ForC resources:

- ForC references are (or should be) listed in the [ForC-db group on Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/community/forc-db/), which is a public repository.
       
- PDFs for some of the publications are listed in ForC [References repository](https://github.com/forc-db/References). This is a private repository, but access will be granted upon request.

4. **If it is not already there, please load publication to ForC [References repository](https://github.com/forc-db/References).** This will help improve ForC for the research community.
