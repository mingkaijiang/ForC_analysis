# How to edit ForC Data (Basic instructions)
We strongly recommend that you discuss any substantive changes with the database PI (@teixeirak) before proceeding. Also, if  you are planning to make a contribution that will take more than a few hours to complete, we recommend creation of an issue in Github to alert database owners about the changes intended to be made. This will avoid potential duplication of efforts / conflicted versions and allow database owners to provide any necessary guidance.

**We advise you read through this guide in full _before_ entering data. Please direct any questions to database moderators.**

## Setting up to edit ForC on your desktop

1.	Download the [Github desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) and create a new branch in Github in the [ForC](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/tree/master/data) repository with your username as the branch name. This allows you to edit the data on your own, and then when you’re finished, a moderator will review the changes you’ve made before they are merged with the data in the master branch.
    
    a. Navigate to the "Current branch" dropdown menu in the desktop app and select "New branch." Enter in your username and select "Publish branch."

2.	Clone the ForC repository to your desktop (e.g., using GitHub Desktop application). Instructions on cloning repositories are [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/). This gives you local copies of the folders and associated files.  
    
    a.	Before looking at any data on your local file, you should make sure you have the current version, as this data can be revised simultaneously.
    
        i. Navigate in Github Desktop to the ForC repository (under “Current repository” in upper left).
        
        ii.“Current branch” should say “master.”
        
        iii. Click “Fetch origin” to download the most recent data from Github.

3.  If you will be adding a lot of data/ working extensively with the database, request access to and clone the [References](https://github.com/forc-db/References) and [ForC_private](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC_private) repositories. 
    
    a. References is private because it contains documents with copyright restrictions. Access will be granted upon request to @teixeirak.
   
    b. ForC_private contains intermediary data sheets and other materials documenting the history of transferring data from original studies to ForC. Access may be requested from @teixeirak.

 
*Github links are provided in this guide, but once these repositories are downloaded, the files can be opened straight from the local file sources and pushed to Github via the desktop application.*

## Preparing for data entry
We recommend having this guide and the [metadata](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/tree/master/metadata) for each .csv file open for easy reference. Note that some fields of metadata tables are cut off from view when viewed online (need to scroll across table to see all). Alternatively, the metadata can be viewed as a continuous pdf [here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fecy.2229&file=ecy2229-sup-0002-MetadataS1.pdf).

4.	Before proceeding with data entry, we need to check if the data / site has already been entered in the database to avoid duplicate entries and contrasting site records for the same site.
    
    a.	Navigate to your local copy of the data csv files (ForC\data).

    b.	In ForC_measurements.csv, check
    
        i. citation.ID (Column AL). Recommend this is checked first.
        
        ii. sites.sitename (Column B)
        
    c.	In ForC_sites.csv, check:
    
        i. sites.sitename (Column B)
        
        ii. lat (Column I) & lon (Column J)
        
        iii. masl (Column K)
    
    d. In the main ForC repo, check "[ForC_sites_map.html](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/ForC_sites_map.html)" to see an interactive world map of recorded sites in the database.
        
5.	If the site already exists in the database and site-related data matches, use the same sites.sitename. Check plots associated with that site and select the appropriate one or, if not already present, you'll need to add a new one (and add appropriate records for it to `HISTORY`). 

6.	If the data has not already been entered in the database, acquire the original data publication and supplement if available. 

    a. First, populate the [ForC_citations.csv](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/data/ForC_citations.csv) with the information from the publication. Descriptions of the headers can be found in the [metadata](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/metadata/citations_metadata.csv).
    
    b. Next, save the publication in the [References](https://github.com/forc-db/References) repository. 

        i. 	Change file name to be citationID.
    
        ii.	If adding supplements as separate documents, create a folder labeled with the publication's citation.ID. Change the supplements' file names so they are clearly appended to citationID. For example, table S3 of Chave et al 2008 becomes Chave_2008_aefa.tableS3.



## Entering Data
Before editing, make sure you have the current version of the data (see step 2a).

NOTE: ForC does not contain special characters. These should be converted to the closest equivalent. 

7.	Use data from the paper to populate the data sheets, following guidance of metadata files describing each field. Most studies present data for multiple sites, plots, variables, measurement intervals, etc. Please be sure to add a separate entry in the measurements.csv file for each site. **In addition, each separate variable should receive its own line of entry.** 
- _For example if Chave_2008_aefa measured both delta.agb_OM and ANPP_woody_stem for 5 sites, then you should add 10 rows in the measurements.csv._

    a.	We recommend entering data using these .csv files in the following order:
    
        i. SITES (if adding a completely new site)
        
        ii. HISTORY (used to automatically generate PLOTS)
        
        iii. MEASUREMENTS
                -NOTE: If records already exist for the plot, you can typically base your entry for 
                Columns D-H (vegetation descriptors) on what’s already been entered, unless this has 
                changed (via a major disturbance or succession).
        
        iii. METHODOLOGY
        
        iv. ALLOMETRY   
        
      The remaining .csv files (VARIABLES, HISTTYPE, PFT) require updates only when new variables, disturbance type, and plant functional type, respectively, are introduced. In other words, these should rarely be updated.
        
    b.	To add data, either add new rows to the bottom of each file or replace old files with your updated ones.
    
    c.	Every cell should have a value. For missing data, please use [missing_value_codes](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/metadata/missing%20value%20codes.csv) to indicate reason for missing values. The code "NAC" may be used to (temporarily) fill in fields for which data may be available but cannot readily be entered. Thus, difficulty filling out all fields should not be a barrier to adding data. 
    
    d. If you are working with a database that references different sites (that are not already in ForC), please populate the [ForC_sites.csv](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/data/ForC_sites.csv) with as much information as your paper gives. The most important entry is having a relevant *sites.sitename* (be specific).
    
    e. In the [ForC_measurements.csv](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/data/ForC_measurements.csv), the method.ID code can vary per variable per study. Please make sure you are entering the correct code (taken from the [ForC_methodology.csv](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/data/ForC_methodology.csv)).
    
   

  
## Pushing to Github and Saving your branch to the Master

**Merging branches can create unforeseen challenges. It is strongly advisable you consult with database moderators *before* you begin editing the data (see top of this guide).**

8. As you progress with data entry, commit changes to your personal branch (we recommend relatively frequent commits, which save traceable / recoverable history of your work). This is done via GitHub desktop.

    a.	Navigate to “Current Repository” and choose the “ForC” repository from the dropdown menu.
    
    b.	Important. Then, navigate to “Current branch” and select your branch. 
    
    c.	On the left, you should see a log of your changed files. Write a summary in the box along with a description of what you’ve updated, then select “Commit to (yourbranchname).” 
    
    d. The header bar should now read "Push origin" on the right. Navigate and select to make sure your commit goes to the Github site.

9. **Please see above Step 8.** We recommend saving your personal branch to the master either when the data entry is complete or you have finished entering data for the time being. If you need to come back and finish entering values, we advise creating an issue in Github stating "Finish entering XXX data," for example, or if you already have an issue, you can add a comment on it to indicate your updates.
    
    a. We also advise creating an issue for each study or set of studies you are working on.

10.	Once data entry is complete (all tables from 9.a. above, with "NAC" codes acceptable), and you have committed your changes *plus* pushed to Github, open a Pull request, also on Github desktop. This will compare the data you’ve entered with the data in the master branch.

    a.	Select “Branch” on top menu, then select “Create pull request.”
    
    b.	This will take you to the Github website and shows the Summary of your commit. Make sure data updates are clear and any questions noted.
    
    c.	Select “Create pull request.” 

11.	Database moderators will approve the pull request and merge the changes. If anything needs to be checked or corrected, moderators will alert you for next steps.

12. Once the pull request is submitted, please close the issue you created (if you created one as in Step 9 above). Navigate to your [issue](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/issues/), comment "Data entry complete", and select "Close and Comment."
